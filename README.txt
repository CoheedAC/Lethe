Hi Gregory!

\\Instructions to Build and Execute Project Lethe
Open the “Lethe” project in Android Studio. Once loaded, click the Run menu then “Run App”. 
This will build, compile, and execute the app. Make sure to have an emulator running (we suggest Genymotion) or 
an android phone plugged in.

\\How to use Project Lethe
Use as you would any other social media application. The app does not pull from the server when you open it. 
Click the refresh button in the feed tab (labeled “Home”) to get all of the images. Tap the camera button in the 
action bar to post an image to the server. Tap the me tab to see what images you have posted to the server. 
Tap the more tab to look at social media outlets and future legality information. The peek tab has not been fully 
implemented so do not use this portion of the app.

\\Storage of Data Files
Photos are stored on the SD card privately (meaning not accessible from other apps) if the SD card is present. 
Otherwise, everything is stored on the internal storage. Images pulled from the server are stored in a cache folder.

\\\\Special Information (Known bugs, anomalies, etc)

\\Peek Tab
Requires Google Play Services, which cannot be installed in the emulator, so you have to test on your own device.

\\More Tab
The Privacy Policy and Terms of Service buttons are not linking to text yet because we have not contacted 
our lawyer about drafting these documents yet.
The Contact Us button requires the emulator/phone to have the email client set up before use.
